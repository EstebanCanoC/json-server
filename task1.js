// Task 1: This function returns the base URL of the server
export function getServerURL() {
   return "http://localhost:3000";
}
// Step 1: Define the base URL of the server where the API is hosted
// This is typically the root URL that will be used in conjunction with specific endpoints
// For example, if you want to access the "/users" endpoint, you would concatenate this base URL with "/users"
// The returned string "http://localhost:3000" is the base URL for the server
// The final URL would be "http://localhost:3000/users"
